## Description



## Installation

To get the app up and running on your machine follow these steps.

1. Clone repo onto your machine with the `git clone https://github.com/jappelgren/grub-goblin.git` command.
2. Create a database named `prime_app`.
3. Run the ```CREATE TABLE``` queries in the `database.sql` file.  
*DO NOT RUN THE INSERT QUERIES YET*
4. Run `npm install` to install all necessary dependencies.
5. `npm run server` to start the server.
